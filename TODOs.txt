- Need to look into adding the correct fields to `project.clj` so that the
  dependencies are properly taken care of. I have added the `deps.edn` file, but
  I don't know what else needs to be done
- There's a TODO in `math` that talks about proper color mapping
- Start building a VERY simple GUI. One in which colors can be adjusted, so that
  I can test basic functions like `f(z) = z`. Or other things that I can just
  write myself.
  - At this point, I'm not going to worry about threading, I don't
    think. I can deal with that after I get the basics going. No need to make it
    more complicated right off the bat.
- Write a macro that mixes the functionality of `let` and `letfn`, because right
  now, I find myself wanting to use both at the same time, but I don't want to
  keep nesting `(let [] (letfn [] (let [] ...)))`
